python number guessing game 

# for guessing the number there is two ways
1) the user can think of a number and from certain 
information the computer has to guess the users number

2) the user has to guess the random number that computer
generates itself.
--> for this aproach certain things that we need in code are:
1) a code for generating random number and it should be added in a variable
   - import random ( this is a module(module is something ie a file that contains certain program writen by other)
 which contains certain functions,classes,variables
allows user to use functions like random.ranint(a,b)
this allows  the program to generate a random value between a and b.

2) attempt variable to count no of attempts
( we use this to properly record the attempts of user to guess a number)

3) number variable for user to guess  the number
use this to get value from the user

4) loop for suggesting user if they are near that number
 we use a ( while True ) because:
- it allows user to run loop until it is stopped manually ie.brake
- use it when we dont know how many times a loop must continue.

also we use a try block because:
- we dont know how many trial  we need to guess a number so 
try is an error handeling block that handels the failuer in a
controlled manner(ie if a user enters abc in program it crashes but with the use of try 
it gives a proper message with help of ( except ValueError block)

5)  proper message for guessing and  retry

6) end

 
# CONCEPT COVERED 
-Input/Output

-Loops

-Conditionals

-Random numbers

-Functions (optional):
def random_num_guess() we have used this function 
as its a block of code that performs certain task which allows us to recall it from any where from program.

import random

def random_num_guess():
    random_number=random.randint(1,100)
    attempts=0
    print("WELCOME TO RANDOM NUMBER GUESSING GAME\n")
    print("guess any number between 1 to 100\n")

    while True:
        try:
            number=int(input("Enter a number"))
            attempts+= 1

            if number < random_number:
                print("guess higher(could be less or more)")

            elif number > random_number:
                print("guess lower(could be less or more)")

            else:
                # use of f string
                print(f"Congratualtion you have guessed the number after {attempts} attempts",attempts)
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("'please enter a valid number")
